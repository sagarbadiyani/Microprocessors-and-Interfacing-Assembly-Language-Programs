Write an ALP that does the following

Open file fil1.txt (file uploaded with question)
The character number from which you read is the number of vowels in your first name – for e.g. if your first name is anupama – number of vowels is 4 and you will start reading from character no. 4 counting from character 0
The number of characters that must be read depends on the number of characters in your first – for e.g. if your first name is anupama – number of characters to be read is 7
Once the characters have been read, they must be displayed.
The row number and column number where the characters must be displayed depends on your date of birth and month for e.g. if you were born on 16th August – the column number from which the display starts will be 16 and the row number will be 08
The foreground color depends on your id number if your id is 2018AAPS0928G – then take the value 09 and add 4 = 13d for to it the foreground color must be bright magenta – pl refer to table below for foreground colors. Back ground color is black and no blinking.

04 red
05 magenta
06 brown
07 white
08 gray
09 bright blue
10 bright green
11 bright cyan
12 bright red
13 bright magenta
14 yellow
15 bright white

The display should continue until the blocking function key is pressed. The blocking function key again depends again on your id no. For e.g. if your id number is 2018AAPS0928G. Then blocking function must be ‘8’
You need calculate these values in the program – you just need to use them. For e.g. you just need to read from row 4 and 7 characters – you need not write a program to calculate the value 4 and 7. Similarly for the display you just need use the values not calculate them in the program.

Evaluation Rubric
Pl Note : Code should run without using the debugger during the demo of the code for evaluation
